#Sacrosanct and Vampiric Thirst ripoff Vampire Overhaul

##Vampire energy

* 4 hunger levels, each has own energy capacity
* Can't go below zero, low initial limit, progress includes widening the capacity
* Can voluntarily drop a hunger level, reset energy meter
* 4 stage hunger means hate, probably vampire bestiality thats only cured by feeding on a human corpse


###Fluid/Discrete vampire enegry 

Should be fluid cos easier to make widget for and can allows draining effect
