# Sacrosanct and Vampiric Thirst ripoff Vampire Overhaul

## General notes

* 4 hunger levels
* Age system
* Reverse progression, but with quirks
* Staying satisfied = being more powerful and having broader variety of options
* Curse can be lifted by a perk or, preferably, an Enai-like quest on feeding on the most powerful

### Reverse progression

* Higher hunger = losing access your access to your feats rather than getting flat weaker and setting gameplay objectives on feeding, whilst providing means to do so
* 4 stage hunger means hate, probably vampire bestiality thats only cured by feeding on a human corpse

## Vampire lord

* Versions of main damaging spell, button to switch them
* Basic vampire drain - low damage and high mana cost, but healz and regenerates vampire energy
* Raze and Bloodstorm - high damage, no healz (dunno bout mana), but expends vampiric energy

## Vampiric energy

* 4 hunger levels, each has own energy capacity
* Can't go below zero, low initial limit, progress includes widening the capacity
* Can voluntarily drop a hunger level, reset energy meter



### Fluid/Discrete vampire enegry 

Should be fluid cos easier to make widget for and can allows draining effect
