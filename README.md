# Sacrosanct and Vampiric Thirst ripoff Vampire Overhaul

## General notes

* Age system
* Reverse progression, but with quirks
* 4 hunger levels
* Enai-like quests to boost your progress immersively (gated by yours/npc level)

### Reverse progression

* Higher hunger = losing access your access to your feats rather than getting flat weaker and setting gameplay objectives on feeding, whilst providing means to do so
* Staying satisfied = being more powerful and having broader variety of options
* 4 stage hunger means hate, probably vampire bestiality thats only cured by feeding on a human corpse
* Curse can be lifted by a perk or, preferably, an Enai-like quest on feeding on the most powerful

### Aging

* Vampiric Thirst like aging
* Aging scales your vampire-related paramaters and generally makes you a stronger vampire
* Possibly gates some ablities or changes perk effects
* Could be boosted by completing certain objectives, to allow for and justify faster aging that generally should be pretty slow
* Could grow naturally alongside players level progression, or gives mechanisms to catch up if you were sired later in game (but nothing radical)

## Vampire powers

### Vampiric energy

* Vampiric energy - resource that is connected to your hunger, but does not define it
* Powers most of vampiric skills and magic
* 4 hunger levels, each has own energy capacity
* Can't go below zero, low initial limit, progress includes widening the capacity
* Can voluntarily drop a hunger level, reset energy meter
* Regenerates to 50% out of combat 

## Vampire magic 

## Vampire lord

* Going melee at early levels/ages due to lack of available magic and vampiric provess
* Thus, switching to vampire magic indicates your growing vampiric powers
* Versions of main damaging spell, button to iterate them
* Basic vampire drain - low damage and high mana cost, but healz and regenerates vampire energy
* Raze and Bloodstorm - high damage, no healz (dunno bout mana), but expends vampiric energy

#### Fluid/Discrete vampire enegry 

Should be fluid cos easier to make widget for and can allows draining effect
