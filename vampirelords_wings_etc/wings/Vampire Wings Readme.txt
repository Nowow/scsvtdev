Custom Vampire Lord Animated Wings (WIP Ver. No. 0.1)

What is this?
This is a small mod that takes a pair of wings from Anton’s “Animated Dragon Wings” and bashes them into the “Custom Vampire Lord” mod by Silvist. 
Requirements. 
You need the following and their respective requirements or this mod will do nothing.
1. “Animated Dragon Wings” mod by Anton  http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53271/? 
2. “Custom Vampire Lord” mod by Silvist  http://www.loverslab.com/files/file/1245-custom-vampire-lord/ 
3. Vampire Wings by yours truly, (meh, the name could probably use some work).

Installation.
1. This does contain one loose script, which will overwrite the original, so using NMM is recommended. Overwrite when prompted.  
2. You need  to go in your Data folder and delete/move/rename the following 3 files,
...Data\Meshes\Armor\Succubus\Wings_0.nif
...Data\Meshes\Armor\Succubus\Wings_1.nif
...Data\Meshes\Armor\Succubus\Wings_gnd.nif
from “Custom Vampire Lord” mod. Not sure how I could make that an automated process. 
3. Done

Uninstallation.
1. If you used NMM for the install, it will restore your original script, if not then I don’t think you need instructions in how to restore it. 
2. If you wish to continue using “Custom Vampire Mod” restore the 3 files. 
3. Done
 
Credits.
1. Anton for the Animated Dragon Wings mod.
2. Silvist for the Custom Vampire Lord mod.

Known bugs.
Sometimes you do not get the wings, well it just means you didn’t hear a bell ring ... uh, that’s an old movie reference ..., anyway you just have to try again, not sure how to fix that just yet.
