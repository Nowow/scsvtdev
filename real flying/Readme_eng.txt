	Description:
This mod allow you to fly a new way. You never fly so easy and natural. Flying mechanics very organically mixed with gaming process.
To start, you need to cook "Mutagen" and drink it. After that your character will get pair of wings on its back. 
Wings are special and tuned for flying and gliding.
Now all you need is just jump forward. (for more info about controls see "Controls" section).



	Features:
- interaction with any collisions by the game's engine while flying.
- convenient controls and overview (by mouse).
- smooth transition between animations and flying stages.
- minimal load on scripting system (if any).
- linked character and wings behaviors (wings are in bundle).


	Controls:
- to begin "Gliding" you need to press and hold "Forward" button then press "Jump".
- in "Gliding" mode you may press "Jump" again to switch to the "Flying" mode ("Forward" key must be hold).
- in "Flying" mode you may use "Sprint"/"Sneak" keys to fly up or lift down ("Forward" key must be hold).
- if you release "Forward" key in any mode - your character will start to falling down.


	Requirements:
SKSE (http://skse.silverlock.org/)
FNIS (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11811)


	Recommendations:
"Pretty Jump Animations" (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56118)
I used its animations (Style 02) in my introduction video.



	Install:
- Unpack archive to the game's folder and activate mod in launcher.
- Run "Generate FNIS for Users.exe" and press "Update" button.
- Cook the "Mutagen" in any cooking pot, then drink it.
	

	Uninstall:	
- Stop your character and drink another (cure) "Mutagen" to remove the wings.
- Save, leave the game and delete all files of the mod.


	Incompatibilities:
- mod may start working wrong if you use another mod, which dynamically make changes to the game's variable "fJumpHeightMin".
(but this is unlikely, I don't know such a mod so far)
	

	Known issues:
- you can't fight while flying
- you can't fly in first person view
